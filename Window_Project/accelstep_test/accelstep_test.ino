// This code does basically the same thing as Example 2, but using
// acceleration/deceleration via the AccelStepper library, 
// and running for twice as many steps. 
// (Thanks Mr. Duffy for pointing out this important fact!) 
// The reason it runs twice as many steps is because we do 
// "pos = -pos" to keep things short and simple. 
// This means that it will run from 0 to 3600, then from 
// 3600 to -3600 (which is 7200 steps).

#include <AccelStepper.h>

// Define a stepper and the pins it will use
AccelStepper stepper(AccelStepper::DRIVER, 5, 3);

int pos = 3600;

void setup()
{ 
  stepper.setMaxSpeed(3000);
  stepper.setAcceleration(1000);
}

void loop()
{
  if (stepper.distanceToGo() == 0)
  {
    delay(500);
    pos = -pos;
    stepper.moveTo(pos);\
  }
  stepper.run();
}
