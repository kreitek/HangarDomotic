// This code does basically the same thing as Example 2, but using
// acceleration/deceleration via the AccelStepper library, 
// and running for twice as many steps. 
// (Thanks Mr. Duffy for pointing out this important fact!) 
// The reason it runs twice as many steps is because we do 
// "pos = -pos" to keep things short and simple. 
// This means that it will run from 0 to 3600, then from 
// 3600 to -3600 (which is 7200 steps).

#define STEPS_PER_MM 200

#include <AccelStepper.h>
// Define a stepper and the pins it will use
AccelStepper stepper(AccelStepper::DRIVER, 5, 3);
int pos = 18 * STEPS_PER_MM;

#define LED_PIN 9
int ledState = LOW;             // ledState used to set the LED
unsigned long previousMillis = 0;        // will store last time LED was updated
const long interval = 1000;           // interval at which to blink (milliseconds)

void setup()
{ 
  stepper.setMaxSpeed(3000);
  stepper.setAcceleration(1000);
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  if (stepper.distanceToGo() == 0)
  {
    delay(500);
    pos = -pos;
    stepper.moveTo(pos);\
  }
  stepper.run();

  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
  if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval) {
    previousMillis = currentMillis;
    if (ledState == LOW)
      ledState = HIGH;
    else
      ledState = LOW;
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, ledState);
  }
